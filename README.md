# Remote server control simulator

## How does it work?

This application has two main functionalities, namely populating the page with a list of various servers to be monitored, and then allowing the user to start and stop a given server. Using a live API server provided with a landing page, the application can make requests to this backend API to obtain and parse data. 

## Installation

All the dependencies used for this application is managed by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Open the browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
