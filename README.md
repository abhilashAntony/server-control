# Remote server control simulator

## Introduction

This Angular codebase demonstrates a dashboard for a simulated remote server monitoring system.

## How does it work?

This application has two main functionalities, namely populating the page with a list of various servers to be monitored, and then allowing the user to start and stop a given server. Using a live API server provided with a given landing page, the application can make requests to this backend API to obtain and parse data. 

## Installation

Have [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed globally. All the dependencies used for this application are managed by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies. Run `ng serve` to start the application as a development server. Open the browser, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
